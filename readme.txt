Offer your Website visitors a FREE Website Analysis from the World's First Transparent Search Engine.

== Description ==

This advanced SEO software plug-in allows you to quickly and easily add a feature that offers your visitors a FREE Website Analysis from a real Search Engine.  The SEO Engine is a new type of Transparent Search Engine that allows users to see, in "real-time", how a Search Engine is scoring and evaluating each and every Webpage and Link inside a Website.  For the first time, users can control their very own Search Engine.  They can make changes to their Website, and instantly see the changes by instructing the SEO Engine to re-crawl and re-analyze their Website -- months in advance of Google, Yahoo!, and Bing.  

Other uses include:

	* Reverse engineer competitor's Websites -- find out how your competitors are ranking high on Search Engines, and copy their strategy!
	* Monitor your Website -- choose any metric inside the SEO Engine, and create SEO Engine Rules which notify you when that rule is triggered.
	* Check the value of your Links -- the SEO Engine calculates the true value of each Link, showing you which ones are the most important.
	* Generate Leads -- "white-label" the SEO Engine interface and turn the Search Engine into your very own, advertising your services.
	* Plus much more...

== Installation ==

	* Unzip to the "wp-content/plugins" directory, activate, and a new menu item will appear on your WordPress install. 
		--> This lets you set your affiliate ID (if you don't have an affiliate ID yet, Register a FREE SEO Engine Account so you can start making money off of your traffic!).
	* Go to Appearance -> Widgets. A new option should be shown: "SEO Engine". This can be placed in any theme that supports Widgets.
	* To customize, make modifications to the form's CSS and attributes depending on the theme. Make sure the "powered by" logo remains on the form, or your Search Bar may stop working.
